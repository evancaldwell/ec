                            <h3>Javascript Is Hard.</h3>
                            <p>When I started this semester I had little eposure to Javascript - basically only what I had taught myself - and I felt that 
                            Javascript was somewhat difficult to usderstand. Not because the syntax was significantly different or the concepts were 
                            radical but rather everytime I followed a tutorial or tried to build something on my own I felt this vast universe of unknown 
                            code and concepts that I would never be able to grasp. For that reason I never took the time to dig deep enough to unravel
                            that knowledge.</p>
                            <h3>Function Before Form</h3>
                            <p>The majority of my personal and professional projects to date have been very data intensive and somewhat complex.
                            Additionally, the client (in some cases myself) has always been less interested in how the end product looks and more 
                            interested in whether or not if performs the functions and how well it performs them. Thus, my process - and focus - has 
                            always been to build functionality first, get a working skeleton and then lay form on top of it - fitting the bits of form to the 
                            already established function.</p>
                            <h3>I Know Best</h3>
                            <p>My personality lends itself to always believing I am right unless someone can provide hard evidence (or a compelling 
                            enough argument) that I am wrong. In many cases this has served me well because people view me as confident and 
                            decisive, I can execute ideas quickly and effectively and I can advocate very thoroughly for causes/ideas that I believe in. 
                            Generally, I win people over to "my side" quite often because it is easy to trust that I'll stick to my guns.</p>
                            <h3>Take The Lead</h3>
                            <p>I find that I often fall into/fit into leadership roles quite easily and frequently. The belief that I know best is one big factor 
                            in that but additionally I have the ability to understand different perspectives and methods of communication. I generally 
                            don't wait around for others to express interest in leading - they would need to make that aparent and/or take initiative to 
                            counteract my efforts. I have had quite a bit of leadership experience and good reports on my leadership ability, so it has 
                            always seemed a natural fit.</p>
                            <h3>Heavier Is Stronger</h3>
                            <p>The code that I have written up to the point where I started this class has generally been very.. explicit. Every piece 
                            spelled out in usually the lengthiest way possible. Heavy on the back end and not very modular. Probably most influenced 
                            by my lack of knowledge and partly by my inexperience with being creative with code. My projects generally work well but 
                            are probably more difficult to maintain and understand than they should be.</p>

                            <h3>Javascript Is Versatile.</h3>
                            <p>Working to intently with Javascript on this project has taught me that JS is not difficult, but more importantly  I learned 
                            how to think about JS differently, how to approach coding differently because of JS. Before I saw JS as a way to manipulate 
                            the page, make interesting effects and process a little data. Now I see JS as a way to augment or replace other technologies 
                            for a smoother working more robust application.</p>
                            <h3>Form Before Function</h3>
                            <p>Perhaps the single more important concept that struck me this semester is the importance that form plays, not only in the 
                            final product but more importantly in the planning process. I look at some of the decisions we made and if I had followed my 
                            prior methods I would have been re-writing code 2 or 3 times. We spent probably 2-3 weeks longer discussing design that I 
                            would normally have done and looking back on it I would have done the project a disservice by pushing function first. The other 
                            piece to this process was understanding how really understanding design so intricately affects function and usually leads to a 
                            simpler product.</p>
                            <h3>I Know Some Stuff</h3>
                            <p>Our group was quite diverse and that diversity really challenged my perception of my own knowledge. I remember very 
                            distincly explaining to the team that we should build out the basic functionality and then work on the design, you walked up and 
                            interjected (suggested) the idea that perhaps we should consider the design a bit longer and more carefully. Of course everyone 
                            else agreed and that really shifted my paradigm and opened me up to all of the other wonderful ideas presented by other goup 
                            members.</p>
                            <h3>Help To Lead</h3>
                            <p>Although many groups/organizations require a leader to function properly, I found that is not always the case. Our group 
                            worked quite well with only a little leadership and as the semester went on I found that I could sometimes be more helpful by 
                            providing guidence and giving someone else the opportunity to lead. Leadership can be very diverse as well and I saw a 
                            different perspective on it as I observed others leading.</p>
                            <h3>Stronger Is Stronger</h3>
                            <p>Our end product was much, much leaner/simpler than our original scope. Not only was the idea scaled back but the amount of 
                            and complexity of the code was also reduced. This led to a much more functional, maintainable and usable product. I found that 
                            I could write more efficient code by taking the time to think about how one function could be made more modular or how a change 
                            in design could simplify user interactions. I know that more experiences developers have many ways of writing more efficient code 
                            but this was a first step for me to internalize the concept of strength in simplicity.</p>
